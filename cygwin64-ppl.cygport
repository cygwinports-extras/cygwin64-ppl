CATEGORY="Libs"
SUMMARY="Parma Polyhedra Library"
DESCRIPTION="The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) provides numerical abstractions
especially targeted at applications in the field of analysis and verification
of complex systems. These abstractions include convex polyhedra, defined as the
intersection of a finite number of (open or closed) halfspaces, each described
by a linear inequality (strict or non-strict) with rational coefficients; some
special classes of polyhedra shapes that offer interesting complexity/precision
tradeoffs; and grids which represent regularly spaced points that satisfy a set
of linear congruence relations."
